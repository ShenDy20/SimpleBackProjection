# SimpleBackProjection
data: detector Timpix3 
#      source Am241


# Including raw data process: 
#          mainly time-walk correction, z-direction length calibration and time-space clustering by dbscan to find all Compton incidents that meet the requirements
#          simple back projection: determine the source location by overlying multiple cones in specific space
