# SimpleBackProjection
data:   
detector Timpix3   
source Am241   

Including  
  
  
Raw data process: mainly time-walk correction, z-direction length calibration and time-space clustering by dbscan to find all Compton incidents that meet the requirements   
    
Simple back projection: determine the source location by overlying multiple cones in specific space
